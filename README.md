# The-Farm-PET

## Docker Info

This project is split into two separate packages: `pet-api` (the PET backend which will perform database operations) and `pet-client` (the React-Bootstrap frontend). Both are containerized and can be started simultaneously with

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start the client at `http://localhost:3000` and the API at `http://localhost:3001`. Try logging in with the email `fido@umass.edu` and password `fido`! To exit, simply press Ctrl+C and wait for the services to stop.

To start an individual service, you can do the following:

```
docker-compose up $SERVICE_NAME
```

where `$SERVICE_NAME` is one of `api`, `client`, or `db`. To start one or all services in "detached" mode, allowing you to return to your command prompt after the service starts, use the `-d` flag.

```bash
# for example
docker-compose up -d api
# or to start all services
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop services after doing this, use `docker-compose down`.

```bash
# an example for one service
docker-compose down api
# or, stop all running services
docker-compose down
```

Note: if you make a change in any source files, for now you will need to tell Docker to rebuild the image for that service in order to see the changes (I'm looking into workarounds to avoid having to do this but for now we need to). To tell Docker to rebuild an image, use the `--build` flag when you bring a service up.

```bash
# for example, if you made some API changes and want to see them, bring the service up like this
docker-compose up --build api
# or just rebuild images for everything
docker-compose up --build
```
